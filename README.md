Introduction:
Created a RESTful API that performs many functionalities. It fetches data from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API and saves the image URL to the database. It can also handle user creation (email only) and update user profiles and ratings.

2. Optional: Create a virtual environment using "python -m venv venv"
3. "pip install -r requirements.txt" to the venv
4. Set up database "flask db init"
5. migrate "flask db migrate"
6. Upgrade: "flask db upgrade"
